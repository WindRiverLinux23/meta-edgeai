Subject: [PATCH] v4l2object: Make number of buffers in own pool same as other
 pool

This will set the number of buffers in own pool same as
other pool (From which buffers gets imported). This will improve
the latency and tolerance to back pressure in pipeline, since it
result in enqueuing of all buffers available in the other pool
